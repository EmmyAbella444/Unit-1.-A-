# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

My client is Ms. Jones. She just moved in to live alone and needs to organize her expenses. She has a lot of interest in cryptocurrencies and currently she is using spreadsheets to store her entire expenses database and so has been facing difficulties in keeping all the data organized because it is not possible for her to find useful statistics of her expenses, and she’s having trouble getting organized with the transactions.

HER INITIAL DATABASE

## Login System
My client requires a system to protect the private data. I thought about using a login system to accomplish this requirement using a if condition and the open command to work with a csv file. 
```.py
def simple_login(user:str, password:str)->bool:
    '''
    Simple authentication, needs fle user.csv
    :param user: string
    :param password: string
    :return: True/False if user is in database
    '''
    with open("user.csv") as file:
        database = file.readlines()
    output = False
    for line in database:
        line_cleaned = line.strip() #remove \n
        user_pass = line_cleaned.split(",")
        if user == user_pass[0] and password == user_pass[1]:
            output = True
            break

    return output


```

## Organize data
My client required an option to show all data organized. I created a file with all the database and an option to open the database and read. After print the data in an organized way.

### database

### code to open, read and print database

## Enter new transactions and saving
My client required an option to enter new transactions and deposit, I create an option that asks the user for the date, category and amount of transaction, and the open the Database file and print the new data

## Graph
My client required an option to show useful statistics. I tought about creating a graph,first open and read the database and the striping and splitting the lines to have the values, date and category. The I sum all the values of the different cattegories and divided by 100 and multiplied a square of by the result and printing creating a graph of the amout of money spend in each category.
