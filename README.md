# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

My client is Ms. Jones. She just moved in to live alone and needs to organize her expenses. She has a lot of interest in cryptocurrencies and currently she is using spreadsheets to store her entire expenses database and so has been facing difficulties in keeping all the data organized because it is not possible for her to find useful statistics of her expenses, and she’s having trouble getting organized with the transactions.

## Login System
My client requires a system to protect the private data. I thought about using a login system to accomplish this requirement using a if condition and the open command to work with a csv file. More description of the code....
```.py
def simple_login(user:str, password:str)->bool:
    '''
    Simple authentication, needs fle user.csv
    :param user: string
    :param password: string
    :return: True/False if user is in database
    '''
    with open("user.csv") as file:
        database = file.readlines()
    output = False
    for line in database:
        line_cleaned = line.strip() #remove \n
        user_pass = line_cleaned.split(",")
        if user == user_pass[0] and password == user_pass[1]:
            output = True
            break

    return output


```
