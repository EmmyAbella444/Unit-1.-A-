# Unit-1.-A-
# Crypto Wallet

# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

Ms. Jones just moved in to live alone and needs to organize her expenses. She has a lot of interest in cryptocurrencies and currently she is using spreadsheets to store her entire expenses database and so has been facing difficulties in keeping all the data organized because it is not possible for her to find useful statistics of her expenses, useful information about the criptocurrency and she is having trouble getting organized with the transactions.


## Proposed Solution


I will design and make a Digial Wallet for a client who is Ms. Jones. The Digital Wallet is constructed using program langague Python, because it is easy to understand compared to other languages and because is extremely powerful and offers a wide possibility of developing systems.I will use the the software pycharm to develope the project because the tool provides code analysis, debugging tool, code completion among other things that facilitate the development of the code. The digital Wallet It will be evaluated according to the success criteria above. It will allow Ms jones to find useful statistics of her expenses, useful information about the criptocurrency and organize her data. Ms.Jones is open to explore a cryptocurrency selected by the developer.That is the reason why I chose Polkadot to be the criptocurrency on the digital wallet. Polkadot is a protocol that connects blockchains, allowing value and data to be sent across previously incompatible networks (Bitcoin and Ethereum, for example) Itâ€™s also designed to be fast and scalable. The DOT token is used for stakin and governance, it can be bought or sold on Coinbase and other exchanges. Due to Polkadot's introduction of numerous advanced technology and trading tools to the crypto market, it has indeed achieved massive growth and was one of the best-performing crypto assets in 2021. As evidence, the price of 1 DOT has rised to 8.3 USD by the beginning of 2022.





## Success Criteria
1. The electronic ledger is a text-based software (Runs in the Terminal).
2. The electronic ledger display the basic description of the cyrptocurrency selected.
3. The electronic ledger allows to enter, withdraw and record transactions.
4. The eletronic ledger show all data organized
5. The eletronic Ledger show grap of  transactions
6. the eletronic Ledger show useful informations of Polkadot
7. The eletronic Ledger show the total spend, the total spend by category and by month.
8. The eletronic ledger can convert Polkadot to Dollars
9. The eletronic Ledger can show informations about the program and author
10. The eletronic Ledger can show the total amount saved.
11. The eletronic Ledge can allow the user to sign in and create a new account or to just login.
12. The eletronic Ledger has a safe login system to protect the data
13. the system has different functions to validate the input

## Login System
My client requires a system to protect the private data. I thought about using a login system to accomplish this requirement using a if condition and the open command to work with a csv file. 
```.py
def simple_login(user:str, password:str)->bool:
    '''
    Simple authentication, needs fle user.csv
    :param user: string
    :param password: string
    :return: True/False if user is in database
    '''
    with open("user.csv") as file:
        database = file.readlines()
    output = False
    for line in database:
        line_cleaned = line.strip() #remove \n
        user_pass = line_cleaned.split(",")
        if user == user_pass[0] and password == user_pass[1]:
            output = True
            break

    return output


```

## Organize data
My client required an option to show all data organized. I created a file with all the database and an option to open the database and read. After print the data in an organized way.

### database

### code to open, read and print database

## Enter new transactions and saving
My client required an option to enter new transactions and deposit, I create an option that asks the user for the date, category and amount of transaction, and then open the Database file and print the new data.

## Graph
My client required an option to show useful statistics. I tought about creating a graph. First the program open and read the database and then strip and split the lines to have the values, date and category. Then I add all the values of the different cattegories and divided by 100 and multiplied a square  by the result and printing creating a graph of the amout of money spend in each category.
